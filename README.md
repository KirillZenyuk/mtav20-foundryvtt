FoundryVTT system for Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition.

This system is built on the basis of the existing MtA v20 system (link: [ma20th]) created by [renanmsouza] (which does
not work in FoundryVTT version 0.8) and VtM 5e System (link: [vtm5e]) created by [Rayji96].

Licensed MtA v20 materials will not be provided, as this is a system provided for public use for free.
